ToDo:
	- write GoogleDocs api wrapper
	- write SVN api wrapper
	- write CLI

Design Rationale:
	Observations on GoogleDocs/traditional-file-system concept mismatch:
		-	the unix/windows/macOs file system is a tree structure (ignoring links)
		-	GoogleDocs uses categories for a relational model, 
			i.e. googleDocs files form a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
		-	consequence: 
				since we have to store the files on a file system we have to simplify the DAG model of GoogleDocs.
				Luckily all the nodes of a DAG visited in a depth first search (DFS) form a tree.
				So the files saved to the SVN repo from google docs will be the result of traversing a users GoogleDocs
				categories/folders depth-first from a user defined start node.
